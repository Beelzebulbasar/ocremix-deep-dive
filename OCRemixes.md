day 1 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks OCR00001-OCR00010. This is extremely early days for OC Remix, and most of the tracks are by djpretzel bootstrapping the site. None of which made it to this list! They're not good!!! This stretch was honestly pretty bad, they pretty clearly hadn't attracted decent talent yet

[OCR00004: Ghosts'n Goblins "Trance Version"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00004) - not amazing, but not bad. track's got that Throbbing Beat 

[OCR00005: OutRun "Instant"](https://ocrmirror.org/files/music/remixes/OutRun_Instant_OC_ReMix.mp3) - this would be a nice little jam if not for those HARSH-ASS 8BIT SOUNDS popping up every so often, what were they thinking

day 1: not a success!

day 2 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks OCR00011-OCR00030. Lotta gaps in this range: [they've removed songs over the years for plagiarism, being substandard, or by author request](https://ocremix.org/info/ReMix_Changelog) (in a few cases someone's track was removed by the review process and then they had everything taken down). This is still extremely early in the ocremix days: most everything is synthwave or adjacent. Still a lot of djpretzel bootstrapping happening here. We are starting to get a _peek_ at The Good Stuff.

[OCR00019: Super Mario Bros. "Frivolous Funk" ](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00019) - This is the first track using live instruments still on the site. It ain't bad, but mostly linking it as a curiosity.

[OCR00022: The Legend of Zelda "Rabbit Joint Cover"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00022) - HELL YEAH HERE WE FUCKIN' GO. This is _classic_ ocremix: it's short, it's fun, and it's hilarious how you used to see this shit on every file sharing program as System of a Down - Legend of Zelda. Love this.

[OCR00026: The Legend of Zelda "Hyrulian"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00026) - Alright djpretzel gonna give you one, but only because I'm a sucker for a filthy remix of the original Zelda theme.

day 3 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks OCR00031-OCR00060. Or more like OCR00034-OCR00060 since 31-33 are long gone. hit the first legit _bad_ remixes here with [OCR 35](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00035), a criminally bad remix a classic Gradius tune, and [OCR 48](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00048) which is... nah dawg, this ain't it. kinda neat to hit the first submissions from dudes like AmIEvil. ain't linking it though! homie had some growing to do

[OCR00053: Mega Man "Elec Man YPOI" ](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00053) - dated AF but the first fun track in this entire stretch. the longer this one goes on the more I warmed up to it. elec man had a good theme y'all!

[OCR00060: Dune "Arrakis (Wormsign Mix)"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00060) - there we go, the kind of chill synth track I've always really enjoyed from ocremix. not a hall-of-famer but not bad

that's it! this stretch sucked!

---

day 4 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks OCR00061-OCR00080. hit a jam early on and rode that high through the whole stretch. it's cool to start seeing more few names I've recognized for a long-ass time, like Ailsean, Dale North, and Mustin (sorry dale i ain't linkin u yet that ff6 medley ain't doin the job)

[OCR00063: Final Fantasy VII "Final Ecstasy"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00063) - man I really like Prelude, got a relaxing mix here. I've had a couple Ailsean tracks on my rotating music player for 20 years now, this is one of the first tracks I listened to multiple times on my journey through the catalogue

[OCR00065: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past "hyrule castle dark world"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00065) - don't think I'm gonna add this cut of the LttP castle theme to my rotation but for whatever reason I felt like linking it (to the past)

[OCR00067: Mega Man 2 "Flash Fire"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00067) - can't decide if I want to include this or not. will i delete it? won't know until go time!

[OCR00069: Contra "Contravirt"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00069) - Nice.

[OCR00071: Mega Man 3 "Blue Bomber Forever" ](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00071) - mostly linking this Mustin MM3 track for the Dale North slander up top. somewhere down the line I'm gonna hit a Dale North / Mustin collab on the Needle Man theme that I've had in the rotation for decades. this one ain't bad

[OCR00076: Mega Man 2 "Wind Shear"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00076) - fun remix of Air Man's theme

[OCR00077: Chrono Trigger "Revival Day Impoetus"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00077) - rare early djpretezel W, I've had this one in the rotation for a long time

this was a good run, had to prune out some songs I enjoyed so I didn't dump 15 links

--- 

day 5 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks OCR00081-OCR00110. surprised it took this long to hit a Castlevania remix. it wasn't very good! we're still waiting for the goat: goat. sad to discover i've hit the era of remixes with a lotta synthetic claps.

[OCR00082: Zelda II: The Adventure of Link "Thelonius Temple"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00082) - a remix of Zelda II dungeon music before Melee brought it back? hell yeah dude, bring it here

[OCR00098: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past "AmIEviL Dark World"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00098) - this track isn't "good" but the transition around the halfway mark made me laugh 

[OCR00102: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening "Tail Cave (Beatdown Mix)"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00102) - oh here we go, first Scott Peeples track. my guy had some fun stuff

[OCR00109: The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time "Gerudo Peeples"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00109) - SPEAKING OF

there was literally only one track between 102 and 109 that hadn't been removed; lotta gaps here, and slim pickings in what's left

---

day 6 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks OCR00111-OCR00130. hit the first Earthbound track still on the site! djpretzel's submission notes say it's the second put up, but going through the list the first one must've been removed. it's dogwater! absolutely terrible

[OCR00115: Mega Man 3 "It's Boss Time"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00115) - you could almost imagine a MM3 remake/remaster using this somewhere, which is always cool imo. think this might be Gux's first track on the site: I definitely have a few of their tracks in my library

[OCR00118: Castlevania II: Simon's Quest "Bloody Tears Inspired"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00118) - wasn't super feeling this until it goes a little crazy in the back half. not bad. also wow I like it better after getting to the next track still on the site (OCR120): also a Castlevania remix but it suuuuuuuucks; had a hard time making it through 

[OCR00122: Castlevania "Wicked Orchestra"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00122) - and the _next_ track still on the site is more Castlevania. another scott peeples track I've had in my library for ages

[OCR00129: Diablo "Wet Grass Inspired"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00129) - AmIEvil's first moody banger is a Diablo 1 track. his last submission is in April 2003: hope he went out and touched wet grass

[OCR00130: Final Fantasy VI "Back to Towne (Arranged)"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00130) - it's the FF6 town music on piano, the fuck else do you want?

lotta gaps here but some decent stuff in what let's left!

day 7 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget

Went through tracks ~~OCR00131~~OCR00132-OCR00160. we have officially entered the Classics Era. i think i only found one djprtezel remix in this whole stretch, is our suffering finally over?

[OCR00132: Deflektor "Laser Dance"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00132) - i don't know this game. i think this remix goes on maybe a little too long and it loses the plot a bit in the middle. but it still made me smile _immediately_. there's something here

[OCR00134: Castlevania: The Adventure "Tempest Mix"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00134) - it's kinda wild how many original game boy games had some _jams_ usings what is, at least on-paper, the worst sound chip of all time. like they went so hard that they somehow made that gray brick endure as a whole-ass musical instrument. this track's alright, not mkvaffe's best, but it's got me thinkin' 'bout that game boy

[OCR00137: Super Mario 64 "Liquid Mario"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00137) - i love this remix of mario 64's dire, dire docks, i've had it in rotation for ages, absolutely essential ocremix chill track. the next track (like the one before it!) was also mkvaffe but his donkey kong country track is almost _too_ chill, can't have people falling asleep during the daily remixes.

[OCR00146: Mega Man 3 "Gemini Salsa"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00146) - after like five mega man remixes in a row i land on one I've known for years and it's another god damn mkvaffe! he can't keep getting away with this!

[OCR00155: Tetris "MkVaffQuasi Ultimix"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00155) - apparently he can. this is one of my all-time faves, i didn't know he'd made it

[OCR00156: The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past "Dark World Jazz"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00156) - gux dark world jazz! i mentioned in one of the previous posts that one of my faves from Gux was coming up and is it. track is so dumb, love it

[OCR00159: Final Fantasy "Prelude (Refractive Mix)"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00159) - prelude mixes have bonus damage to beelzebulbasaur-infused enemies, even prelude remixes that are just alright

there was so much mkvaffe here; including tracks i didn't link. bro, calm down

day 8 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget. 

Went through tracks OCR00161-OCR00180. this batch was a fuckin' struggle, fam. was not having a good time

[OCR00171: Chrono Cross "Another Inspiration"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00171) - i was ten tracks deep and struggling to let them play out before getting to one i've enjoyed for a really long time. this is an extremely chill remix, although it's not the best version of it: scott revisited it with [Reiterated Inspriation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A83ju2UoH_8) for some remix collab album or another, and that version is still one of my favorite remixes since i'm immensely weak to chill ambient shit

had to tap out after (less than) 20 remixes. this was a marriage-ending rough patch in the catalogue, dang

---

day 9(ish) of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget. 

Was busy yesterday, back to  it today. Went through tracks OCR00181-OCR00200. hit a version of jaxx's forever rachel (a song in my rotation) that isn't the one i know? it fuckin' sucks! looks like that dude went through one hell of a musical glow-up inside of one year

[OCR00191: Xenogears "Broken Mirror Reflection"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00191) - might be the first remix with real vocals still on the site? kinda cheesy but not bad; the Big Sloppy JRPG of remixes

[OCR00198: Bubble Bobble "This Is Not a True Ending (Asphyxiation)"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00198) industrial... bubble bobble?

[OCR00200: Xenogears "Bonds of Sea and Fire"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00200) - kind of a whatever remix but it's pretty close to the original which is an extremely chill track

time to tap out, just got sonically oblitearted by [OCR00199](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00199), an INCREDIBLY questional remix of Celes's theme. 200 down, a little over four thousand to go

---

day 10 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget. 

Went through tracks OCR00201-~~OCR00220~~-OCR00218. this batch flashbanged me with a djpretzel Lunar remix with lyrics. it will not be linked. otherwise had a pretty good time, very few "smell my finger" tracks banished to the DMs

[OCR00201: Mega Man "Cut Man Sonata"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00201) - cut man's theme on a piano? sure, fuck it, why not?

[OCR00205: Final Fantasy VI "Death on the Snowfield"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00205) - YEEEEEAH still a big dumb bitch for the ambient mood shit, have always loved this one, terra's theme undefeated

[OCR00206: Final Fantasy VI "Terra in Black"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00206) - linking two terra's themes in a row and feeling zero bad about it. first one goes slow, second one goes hard. [and apparently ailsean redid it!](https://ailsean.net/music/vg/Ailsean-35-FF6_3US-Terra_Obsidian.mp3)

[OCR00209: The Legend of Zelda "The Music of My Groin"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00209) - i am morally obligated to inflict the music of my groin on you

[OCR00210: Mega Man 2 "Tekno Wily"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00210) - the first mega man 2 wily 1 on the site that doesn't suck ass so it's gettin' linked even if it's just okay

[OCR00215: Super Mario Bros. "Soundcheck"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00215) - this is short and stupid. kinda love it

had a pretty good time with these

---

day 11 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget.

Went through tracks OCR00221-OCR00240. doing a lot of asking: why? why did you remix this track? what made you sit down and decide that some dinky junk track from the Mario RPG soundtrack or whatever needed a remix? help me understand you

[OCR00222: Batman "Music of Funk"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00222) - batman... dance? sure, takes a second to get moving but pretty fun

[OCR00229: Shadowgate "Dancefloor"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00229) - might be a dance night. this **is** shadowgate but it's also mega man 2

[OCR00231: Doom "Doomed"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00231) - textbook chill. lofi beats to relax / think about shotguns to. the longer this went on the more i like it

[OCR00240: Sonic the Hedgehog 3 "IceCapped"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00240) - closing out edm night with some sanic

no all-timers tonight but i've had worse nights doing this

---

day 12 of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget.

Went through tracks OCR00241-OCR00260. One year into the site's lifespan, and MkVaff has absolutely taken djpretzel's place as "dude who is submitting entirely too much shit and most of it kinda mid". djpretzel was bootstrapping the site so I _get it_, and most of MkVaff's stuff isn't _bad_ (I've posted a few of his tracks), but at this point I never get hyped up when I see "by MkVaff".

[OCR00249: Blaster Master "Through the Eyes of Tragedy"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00249) - slap baaaaaaasss! guitars!

[OCR00254: The Guardian Legend "8-bit Rox"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00254) - prozax pulling out some fun guitars in this batch. not super familiar with this game but fun is fun

[OCR00260: Sonic 3D Blast "Dark Puppetry"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00260) - was ready to call this batch a dud and then i hit this chill sonic 3d track. drops the ball a bit in the middle but not bad

lotta gaps here and not a lot really calling to me. oh well!

---

somehow ocremix posting returned: day 13(ish) of posting some chill ocremix.org tracks every day until I forget. 

Went through tracks OCR00261-OCR00280. had to take a few days off for work crunch. first track in this batch was a remix of Magus's theme, except it was just vaguely Magus-themed ambient noise. how the hell do you take a song that had the sickest drop in the year of our lord 1995 and make it all flirt and no fuck?

[OCR00264: Final Fantasy VIII "Eyes on Me (Not Faye Wong)"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00264) - IMMEDIATELY panicked the instant i realized i was about to click an eyes on me cover, but you know what? it kinda works. it ain't perfect by a long shot, but it kinda works

[OCR00268: Super Mario Bros. 2 "Insomnic" ](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00268) - i'm not going to download this track. this remix is not going into my library. but sometimes i appreciate landing on a mix that's only really interested in finding a fresh way to transport you back to another time, a time when jumping around in Mario 2 was all you could have ever wanted from this life

[OCR00269: Chrono Trigger "Winds of Time"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00269) - who cares if a remix is really close to the original when the original is a really fuckin' incredible song?

[OCR00270: Metroid "Metaltroid"](https://ocremix.org/remix/OCR00270) - first half? ehh, whatever. second half? yes. correct.
